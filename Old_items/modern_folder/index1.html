        The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects or "things" embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, which enables these objects to collect and exchange data.

    <p>
    In simple words, the stuff which we saw in the sci-fi movies, such as lights that switch on when we enter the room, smart cars, smart homes, etc, which are being introduced or are on the way of being getting to life are termed the Internet of Things (IoT).
    </p>
    <div>
    The Internet of Things allows objects to be sensed and controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure, creating opportunities for more direct integration between the physical world and computer-based systems, and resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy and economic benefit. Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to interoperate within the existing Internet infrastructure. Experts estimate that the IoT will consist of almost 50 billion objects by 2020.
