        The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects or "things" embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, which enables these objects to collect and exchange data.
    </div>
    <p>
    In simple words, the stuff which we saw in the sci-fi movies, such as lights that switch on when we enter the room, smart cars, smart homes, etc, which are being introduced or are on the way of being getting to life are termed the Internet of Things (IoT).
    </p>
    <div>
    The Internet of Things allows objects to be sensed and controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure, creating opportunities for more direct integration between the physical world and computer-based systems, and resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy and economic benefit. Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to interoperate within the existing Internet infrastructure. Experts estimate that the IoT will consist of almost 50 billion objects by 2020.

    <p class="history">
    As of 2014, the vision of the Internet of Things has evolved due to a convergence of multiple technologies, ranging from wireless communication to the Internet and from embedded systems to micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). This means that the traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems, automation (including home and building automation), and others all contribute to enabling the Internet of Things (IoT).

    <div>
The concept of a network of smart devices was discussed as early as 1982, with a modified Coke machine at Carnegie Mellon University becoming the first internet-connected appliance, able to report its inventory and whether newly loaded drinks were cold. Mark Weiser's seminal 1991 paper on ubiquitous computing, "The Computer of the 21st Century", as well as academic venues such as UbiComp and PerCom produced the contemporary vision of IoT.

    According to Gartner, Inc. (a technology research and advisory corporation), there will be nearly 26 billion devices on the Internet of Things by 2020. ABI Research estimates that more than 30 billion devices will be wirelessly connected to the Internet of Things by 2020. As per a recent survey and study done by Pew Research Internet Project, a large majority of the technology experts and engaged Internet users who responded - 83 percent - agreed with the notion that the Internet/Cloud of Things, embedded and wearable computing (and the corresponding dynamic systems) will have widespread and beneficial effects by 2025.

    We can monitor our homes and families remotely to keep them safe. Businesses can improve processes to increase productivity and reduce material waste and unforeseen downtime. Sensors in city infrastructure can help reduce road congestion and warn us when infrastructure is in danger of crumbling. Gadgets out in the open can monitor for changing environmental conditions and warn us of impending disasters.

    In IoT discussions, it's recognized from the onset that analytics technologies are critical for turning this tide of streaming source data into informative, aware and useful knowledge. In traditional analysis, data is stored and then analyzed. However, with streaming data, the models and algorithms are stored and the data passes through them for analysis. This type of analysis makes it possible to identify and examine patterns of interest as data is being created - in real time.
    </div>
    <p>
So before the data is stored, in the cloud or in any high-performance repository, you process it automatically. Then, you use analytics to decipher the data, all while your devices continue to emit and receive data.With advanced analytics techniques, data stream analytics can move beyond monitoring existing conditions and evaluating thresholds to predicting future scenarios and examining complex questions.
        </p>
    <div>
To assess the future using these data streams, you need high-performance technologies that identify patterns in your data as they occur. Once a pattern is recognized, metrics embedded into the data stream drive automatic adjustments in connected systems or initiate alerts for immediate actions and better decisions.Essentially, this means you can move beyond monitoring conditions and thresholds to assessing likely future events and planning for countless what-if scenarios.
