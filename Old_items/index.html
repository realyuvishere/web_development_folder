<h2>Great Pyramid of Giza</h2>
</header>
<div class="mainBod">
    <div class="mainContent2">
    The Great Pyramid of Giza (also known as the Pyramid of Khufu or the Pyramid of Cheops) is the oldest and largest of the three pyramids in the Giza pyramid complex bordering what is now El Giza, Egypt. It is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely intact.<br><br>
    Based on a mark in an interior chamber naming the work gang and a reference to fourth dynasty Egyptian Pharaoh Khufu, Egyptologists believe that the pyramid was built as a tomb over a 10 to 20-year period concluding around 2560 BC.

<h2>Great Wall of China</h2>

<div class="mainBod">
<div class="mainContent2">
The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, generally built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the <a onclick="getElementById('meaning').style.display = 'block'" class="meaning" title="Eurasian Steppe, click for the meaning">Eurasian Steppe.</a><br><br>
Several walls were being built as early as the 7th century BCE. These, later joined together and made bigger and stronger, are now collectively referred to as the Great Wall. Especially famous is the wall built between 220-206 BCE by Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. Little of that wall remains.

<h2>The Colosseum</h2>
</header>
<div class="mainBod">
<div class="mainContent2">
The Colosseum or Coliseum , also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre , is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy. Built of concrete and sand, it is the largest amphitheatre ever built and is considered one of the greatest works of architecture and engineering ever.<br><br>
The Colosseum is situated just east of the Roman Forum. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in 72 AD, and was completed in 80 AD under his successor and heir Titus. Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (81 - 96). These three emperors are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named in Latin for its association with their family name.

<h2>Chichen Itza</h2>

Chichen Itza was a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people of the Terminal Classic period. The archaeological site is located in Tinum Municipality, Yucatn State, Mexico.<br><br>
Chichen Itza was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD 600-900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800-900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900-1200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands.
